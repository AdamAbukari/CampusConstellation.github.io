# Campus Constellation  
*The University Ecosystem Project*

**Mission Statement**  
"To connect every university student with everything they need on campus through a single, student-powered ecosystem that saves time, money, and builds community."

### Three Core Principles
1. **Student-First Design** — Built by students, for students  
2. **Community Economics** — Value circulates within the student community  
3. **Zero-Friction Onboarding** — No barriers to entry for users or student businesses
